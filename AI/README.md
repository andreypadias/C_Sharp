# 🤖 AI Projects Hub

Welcome to the **AI Projects** folder!  
This is the central space for developing all things related to **Artificial Intelligence**, including:

- 🧠 AI Agents  
- 🌐 AI APIs  
- 💡 Experimental AI Tools and Models  
- 🛠️ Machine Learning Utilities  
- 📊 Data Processing and Analysis Scripts

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder is meant to organize and grow a collection of AI-centric codebases, prototypes, and applications.  
It’s a playground for building intelligent systems — from simple automation agents to full-blown API integrations with AI models.

---

## 🧰 What You’ll Find

Inside, you might encounter:

- 🤖 Intelligent Agents (chatbots, autonomous tools)
- 🌍 APIs that integrate with OpenAI, Hugging Face, etc.
- 🧪 ML models and training scripts
- 🧾 Prompt engineering experiments
- 📂 Utilities for data parsing, cleaning, and inference

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

Projects may include combinations of:

- **Python**, **C#**, or **JavaScript**
- **OpenAI API**, **Hugging Face**, **LangChain**
- **FastAPI**, **Flask**, or **Express**
- **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Explore subfolders to find specific projects
2. Follow the README in each project folder for setup instructions
3. Clone, run, or contribute to any project!

```bash
cd ai-project-folder
# Follow individual instructions per project
```

---

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep each AI project modular and well-documented
- Store API keys securely (never hard-code them!)
- Use virtual environments and requirements files
- Maintain README files for every project
