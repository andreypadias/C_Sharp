# 🗂️ C# Console Projects

Welcome to the **C# Console Projects** directory!  
This folder is dedicated to a collection of projects built using **C#** and the **.NET SDK**, designed to run in the terminal.

---

## 💡 Purpose

This directory serves as a hub for all console-based applications developed in C#.  
Whether you're learning, experimenting, or building utilities, this is the place to organize and showcase your work.

---

## 📁 What's Inside?

Each subfolder contains a standalone project with its own:

- 📦 Source Code (`.cs` files)
- 🧠 Logic and Models
- 📄 README documentation
- 🛠️ `Program.cs` entry point

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

To build and run these projects, make sure you have:

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or later

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run a specific project:

```bash
cd ProjectFolderName
dotnet run
```

Replace `ProjectFolderName` with the actual folder name of the project you want to run.

---

## 📌 Tips

- Keep each project in a separate folder
- Include a README in each project
- Use meaningful names and comments in your code
- Commit your work regularly using version control (e.g., Git)

## 🙌 Happy Coding!

Enjoy building and exploring the power of C# on the console.  
Feel free to expand this collection with more creative and practical projects!
